# SafeSpace

SafeSpace is a Google Chrome extension which uses user submitted ratings to filter out commenters on YouTube.
Users are able to rank users based on the content of their comments.
Users who harass others or post vulgar comments can be given a bad rating while users who post normal comments can be given a good rating.
Users whose bad ratings outweigh good ones will have their comments hidden from everyone using SafeSpace.
The goal of this extension is not to censor users but instead to provide a more constructive browsing experience.
Because of this, hidden comments can easily be shown with the press of a button.

SafeSpace was developed in during a 24 hour hackathon.
